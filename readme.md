CSV Import for Wolf CMS
======================

Plugin for importing **.csv**, **.tsv** and **.txt** spreadsheet exported files into Wolf CMS pages and parts.

This plugin provides a convenient way to import **Excel** / **Open Office Calc** table into Wolf CMS. All you need to do is export the spreadsheet to one of supported **.csv**, **.tsv** or **.txt** formats, upload the file to **[CMS_ROOT]/public"** folder and tweak some import settings like:

- column **delimeter** character _(usually a comma, semicolon or tabulator)_
- cell contents **enclosure** character _(usually double- or single-quote)_
- **escape character** _(usually backslash but Excel seems to use double quote)_
- **character encoding** _(like WINDOWS-1252, ISO-8859-2, etc.)_
- imported file **locale** _(like pl_PL, en_US, de_AT, etc.)_

If the first row of your table contains one of the following fields:

- slug - **required** _(and only rows with unique slugs will be imported)_
- title
- breadcrumb
- keywords
- description
- created_on
- published_on
- valid_until
- tags

The Page properties will be set accordingly to those fields. Any other properly named _(english letters + digits)_ columns will be added as **Page Parts**.

Adjusting those settings will most likely lead to valid table interpretation. If everything is OK you can import new pages and page parts.
